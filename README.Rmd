# Calcom Expansions

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

An automated version of Don's Visual Basic calcom expansion code rewritten in R. 

## Installation

Before installing the calcomExpansions package you should ensure that Java is 
installed on your computer. Please visit http://www.java.com for information 
on installing Java on your particular system.

To install the latest version of the package:
``` r
install.packages("devtools") #if required
devtools::install_github("chisquareotops/calcomExpansions")
```

Upon installing, some unix-based systems may need to to have Java reconfigured with R by running 
the following command in the terminal: 
```bash
sudo R CMD javareconf
```

<!--
upon installing RJDBC you may need to run "R CMD javareconf" command in the 
#terminal as root to add Java support to R.

Additionally, two JDBC drivers are required for access to the CALCOM and Pacfin Databases.
These drivers need to be in the current working directory of R when running this expansion code.
The getDrivers() function can/should be run from the current working directory of R before running the expansion code.
