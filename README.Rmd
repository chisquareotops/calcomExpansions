# Calcom Expansions

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

An automated version of Don's Visual Basic calcom expansion code rewritten in R. 

## Installation

Before installing the calcomExpansions package you should ensure that Java is 
installed on your computer. Please visit http://www.java.com for information 
on installing Java on your particular system.

To install the latest version of the `calcomExpansions` package you can run the 
following in an R shell:
```
R> install.packages("devtools") #if required
R> devtools::install_github("chisquareotops/calcomExpansions")
```

Upon installing, some unix-based systems may need to to have Java reconfigured with R by running 
the following command in the terminal: 
```
bash$ sudo R CMD javareconf
```

<!--
upon installing RJDBC you may need to run "R CMD javareconf" command in the 
#terminal as root to add Java support to R.

Additionally, two JDBC drivers are required for access to the CALCOM and Pacfin Databases.
These drivers need to be in the current working directory of R when running this expansion code.
The getDrivers() function can/should be run from the current working directory of R before running the expansion code.
-->

## Package Use

Calcom expansions combine information from both the PacFIN and Calcom databases 
and are completed on a yearly basis. The `calcomExpansions` package provides 
functions for gathering and preparing the data necessary for completing 
expansions, and several core functions for executing and exporting species and 
length expansions (age expansions coming soon). 

A typical use-case for this package will require access to both the PacFIN and 
Calcom databases. If you have not setup database access for these databases 
you will need to arrange access to these databases prior to using this 
package. Contact XXXX for access to the PacFIN database. Contact YYYY for 
access to the Calcom database and/or PSMFC VPN.

### Species Expansion

The data for species expansions are collected and prepared by the two helper 
functions `getPacfinSppData` and `getCalcomSppData`. 

The `getPacfinSppData(year, save = F, fromFile = F)` function prepares an R 
data.frame from the necessary PacFIN database calls needed to perform a 
species expansion. By default this function connects to the PacFIN database to 
prepare its output. If run with `save=True`, then the output will be saved to 
a local csv file for reproducibility and/or convenience purposes. If a local 
csv is present on your system, `getPacfinSppData` can be run with 
`fromFile=True` to bypass VPN and database connections.

A typical use will look like:
```
R> year = 2019	
R> pacfinSpp = getPacfinSppData(year)

```

Similarly the `getCalcomSppData(year, save = F, fromFile = F)` function 
prepares an R list from the necessary Calcom database calls needed to perform a 
species expansion. By default this function connects to the Calcom database to 
prepare its output. If run with `save=True`, then the output will be saved to 
a local .rda file for reproducibility and/or convenience purposes. If a local .rda 
is present on your system, `getCalcomSppData` can be run with `fromFile=True` 
to bypass VPN and database connections.

A typical use will look like:
```
R> calcomSpp = getCalcomSppData(year)

```

Once both the PacFIN and Calcom data have been prepared, the data can be passed 
to `estSppComp` function to perform the species composition expansion as follows.
```
R> sppExp = estSppComp(pacfinSpp, calcomSpp)
```

The `estSppComp(pacfinData, calcomData, portBorr = portMatrix2, qtrBorr = qtrMatrix, files = T)` 
function uses the two optional arguments `portBorr` and `qtrBorr` to establish 
port complex and quarter borrowing rules to expand strata in which no data 
exists. By default the matrices `portMatrix2` and `qtrMatrix` are supplied 
which define the established species expansion borrowing standards used by 
Calcom (Pearson, D. E. and Erwin, B., 1997). For more details about the structure of these matrices, and the 
borrowing rules they imply, see the R help pages for these data structures 
(i.e. `?portMatrix2' or `?qtrMatrix` in an R shell). 

If manual adjusting of particular borrows are required (exceptions to the 
borrowing rules implied by the given portBorr and qtrBorr arguments) the 
`estSppCompDoc(pacfinData, calcomData, doc = "sppdocYYYY.csv", qtrBorr = qtrMatrix, files = T)`
function may be used to to modify the borrows performed by `estSppComp`. 
For more details about editing particular borrows via the expansion 
documentation files see the R help page for the `estSppCompDoc` function 
(i.e. `?estSppCompDoc` in an R shell).

Once the expansion is complete the results may be exported in several different 
formats by the `exportSpp(exp, human = T, pacfin = T, calcom = F, doc = NULL)` function. 
See the R help page for details about the various export formats available 
(i.e. `?exportSpp` in an R shell). 
```
R> exportSpp(sppExp)
```

Stripping out the commentary from the above examples results in a default 
species expansion in R.
```
R> year = 2019	#Vectorized in year. year=2018:2023 would also work. 
R> pacfinSpp = getPacfinSppData(year)

R> calcomSpp = getCalcomSppData(year)

R> sppExp = estSppComp(pacfinSpp, calcomSpp)
R> exportSpp(sppExp)
```

### Length Expansion

Length (and age) expansions depend on the species expansion results in given 
year. Thus, if the species expansion for the year of interest has not been 
updated in Calcom, the species expansions should be completed and exported to 
Calcom prior to performing the Length expansion.

The length expansion does not directly depend on PacFIN. Therefore the data 
preparation for length expansions only involves the function 
`getCalcomLenData(year, save = F, fromFile = F)`. This function behaves largely 
the same as `getCalcomSppData`, with arguments for saving the prepared data 
locally as well as an option to read in previously prepared data from file.

```
R> year = 2019 
R> calcomLen = getCalcomLenData(year)

CALCOM User: ********
Password: ****************
```

Once both the Calcom data has been prepared, the data can be passed
to the `estLenComp` function to perform the length composition expansion.
```
R> lenExp = estLenComp(calcomLen)
```

Similarly to `estSppComp`, the `estLenComp(calcomData, portBorr = portMatrix1, files = T)`
function uses the optional argument `portBorr` to establish port complex 
borrowing rules to expand length to strata in which no data exists. By default 
the matrices `portMatrix1` is supplied which defines the established 
borrowing standards used by Calcom (Pearson, D. E. and Erwin, B. (1997)) length expansions. For more 
details about the structure of this matrices, and the borrowing rules
it implies, see the R help page for this data structure 
(i.e. `?portMatrix1 in an R shell).

If manual adjusting of particular borrows are required (exceptions to the
borrowing rules implied by the given portBorr argument) the
`estLenCompDoc(calcomData, doc = "lendocYYYY.csv", files = T)`
function may be used to to modify the borrows performed by `estLenComp`.
For more details about editing particular borrows via the expansion
documentation files see the R help page for the `estLenCompDoc` function
(i.e. `?estLenCompDoc` in an R shell).


Stripping out the commentary from the above length expansion example results 
in a default length expansion in R.
```
R> year = 2019	#Vectorized in year. year=2018:2023 would also work. 
R> calcomLen = getCalcomLenData(year)

Reading CALCOM Length Data From CALCOM Connection...
CALCOM User: ********
Password: ****************

R> lenExp = estLenComp(calcomLen)
```
