# Calcom Expansions

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

An automated version of Don's Visual Basic calcom expansion code rewritten in R. 

## Installation

Before installing the calcomExpansions package you should ensure that Java is 
installed on your computer. Please visit http://www.java.com for information 
on installing Java on your particular system.

To install the latest version of the `calcomExpansions` package you can run the 
following in an R shell:
```
R> install.packages("devtools") #if required
R> devtools::install_github("chisquareotops/calcomExpansions")
```

Upon installing, some unix-based systems may need to to have Java reconfigured with R by running 
the following command in the terminal: 
```
bash$ sudo R CMD javareconf
```

<!--
upon installing RJDBC you may need to run "R CMD javareconf" command in the 
#terminal as root to add Java support to R.

Additionally, two JDBC drivers are required for access to the CALCOM and Pacfin Databases.
These drivers need to be in the current working directory of R when running this expansion code.
The getDrivers() function can/should be run from the current working directory of R before running the expansion code.
-->

## Package Use

Calcom expansions combine information from both the PacFIN and CalCOM databses 
and are completed on a yearly basis. The `calcomExpansions` package provides 
functions for gathering and preparing the data neccessary for completing 
expansions, and several core functions for executing and exporting species and 
length expansions (age expansions coming soon). 

A typical use-case for this package will require access to both the PacFIN and 
CalCOM databases. If you have not setup database access for these databases 
you will need to arrange access to these databases prior to using this 
package. Contact XXXX for access to the PacFIN database. Contact YYYY for 
access to the CalCOM database and/or PSMFC VPN.

### Species Expansion

The data for species expansions are collected and prepared by the two helper 
functions `getPacfinSppData` and `getCalcomSppData`. 

The `getPacfinSppData(year, save = F, fromFile = F)` function prepares an R 
data.frame from the neccessary PacFIN database calls needed to perform a 
species expansion. By default this function connects to the PacFIN database to 
prepare its output. If run with `save=True`, then the output will be saved to 
a local csv file for replicability and/or convienience purposes. If a local 
csv is present on your system, `getPacfinSppData` can be run with 
`fromFile=True` to bypass VPN and database connections.

A typical use will look like:
```
R> year = 2019	
R> pacfinSpp = getPacfinSppData(year)

```

Similarly the `getCalcomSppData(year, save = F, fromFile = F)` function 
prepares an R list from the neccessary Calcom database calls needed to perform a 
species expansion. By default this function connects to the Calcom database to 
prepare its output. If run with `save=True`, then the output will be saved to 
a local .rda file for replicability and/or convience purposes. If a local .rda 
is present on your system, `getCalcomSppData` can be run with `fromFile=True` 
to bypass VPN and database connections.

A typical use will look like:
```
R> calcomSpp = getCalcomSppData(year)

```

Once both the PacFIN and Calcom data have been prepared, the data can be passed 
to `estSppComp` function to perform the species composition expansion as follows.
```
R> sppExp = estSppComp(pacfinSpp, calcomSpp)
```

The `estSppComp(pacfinData, calcomData, portBorr = portMatrix2, qtrBorr = qtrMatrix, files = T)` 
function uses the two optional arguments `portBorr` and `qtrBorr` to establish 
port complex and quarter borrowing rules to expand strata in which no data 
exists. By default the matricies `portMatrix2` and `qtrMatrix` are supplied 
which define the long established borrowing standards used by Calcom (CITE). 
For more details about the structure of these matrices, and the borrowing rules 
they imply, see the R help pages for these data structures (i.e. `?portMatrix2' or 
`?qtrMatrix` in an R shell). 

If manual adjusting of particular borrows are required (exceptions to the 
borrowing rules implied by the given portBorr and qtrBorr arguments) the 
`estSppCompDoc(pacfinData, calcomData, doc = "sppdocYYYY.csv", qtrBorr = qtrMatrix, files = T)`
function may be used to to modify the borrows performed by `estSppComp`. 
For more details about editing particular borrows via the expansion 
documentation files see the R help page for these data `estSppCompDoc` 
(i.e. `?estSppCompDoc` in an R shell)

Once the expansion is complete the results may be exported in several different 
formats by the `exportSpp(exp, human = T, pacfin = T, calcom = F, doc = NULL)` function. 
See the R help page for details about the various export formats available 
(i.e. `?exportSpp` in an R shell). 
```
R> exportSpp(sppExp)
```

Stripping out the commentary from the above commands results in the following 
simple example of what a default expansion in 2019entails in R.
```
R> year = 2019	#Vectorized in year. year=2018:2023 would also work. 
R> pacfinSpp = getPacfinSppData(year)

R> calcomSpp = getCalcomSppData(year)

R> sppExp = estSppComp(pacfinSpp, calcomSpp)
R> exportSpp(sppExp)
```

### Length Expansion

```
R> year = 2019	#Vectorized in year. year=2018:2023 would also work. 

R> calcomLen = getCalcomLenData(year)
